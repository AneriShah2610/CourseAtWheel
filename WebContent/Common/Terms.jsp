					<h3> No Academic Credit </h3>
					<p>
						Unless otherwise explicitly indicated by a credit-granting institution, participation in or completion of a course does not confer any academic credit. Even if credit is awarded by one institution, there is no presumption that other institutions will accept that credit. You agree not to accept credit for completing a course unless you have earned a Course Certificate (or other equivalent CourseAtWheel credential) for that course. CourseAtWheel, the course instructors, and the associated participating institutions have no obligation to have a course recognized by any educational institution or accreditation organization.
